This script works only if you have Python installed on your system and the necessary Python libraries are available.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use:
1. Open the application and click the Browse button to select the path of your .py script.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If PyInstaller is not installed in your Python environment, the app will prompt you to install it.
   Click Yes to proceed with the installation.
4. Once the conversion is complete, click the Open EXE Folder button to open the folder where the .exe file was created.
   üö® Note: This will open the folder containing the EXE file, not the EXE itself.
